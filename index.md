**Synopsis:** Introduces USyd’s High Performance Computer (HPC), ‘Artemis’. We cover connecting and navigating Artemis, available software, and how to submit and monitor jobs using the PBS Pro scheduler..

**Target audience:** Students and staff who would like to learn how to run compute jobs on Artemis HPC. Participants must have a valid USyd unikey.

**Follow-on courses:** This course is **part three** of the **[Artemis HPC Training Series]({{ site.series_home }})**.

It follows the introductory courses  [‘_Introduction to Artemis HPC_’]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.introhpc) and [‘_Data transfer and RDS for HPC_’]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.rds).

The final lesson, ['_Matlab on Artemis: The MDCS_']({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.mdcs), is an optional course for users of MATLAB who would like to submit jobs directly to the cluster from their local computers.

> ## Prerequisites
> You must take [‘_Introduction to Artemis HPC_’]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.interhpc) before attempting this course. You are assumed to know how to connect to Artemis, navigate its filesystem and submit jobs to the PBS Scheduler.
>
> Competency on the Unix/Linux command line:
>
> * If you are interested in learning HPC but have no Unix/Linux command-line skills, you MUST first take an [Introduction to Unix/Linux](https://intersect.org.au/training/course/unix) course.
>
> **OWN LAPTOP REQUIRED**.
